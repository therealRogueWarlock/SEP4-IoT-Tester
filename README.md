# SEP4-IoT-Tester
Tester for IoT Production code

This GitHub Repository is made for working with the [IoT Device](https://github.com/marker99/SEP4-IoT)

This acts as a Test Repository, allowing for a Test Environment, that being a Google Test Project, to work with the Production Code, whilst still keeping the actual Production Code in a separate GitHub

This application was developped using Pair Programming between Sander ([Github Account](https://github.com/therealRogueWarlock)) and Frederik ([Github Account](https://github.com/marker99))
